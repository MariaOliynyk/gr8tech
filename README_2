Test Automation Approach – List Breweries API

The List Breweries endpoint (GET /v1/breweries) returns a paginated list of breweries and supports multiple optional
query parameters for filtering and sorting.
I think the most effective automation strategy is to split the work into separate tasks and estimate the effort using
story points.

Automation Approach

Test automation for this endpoint should be implemented incrementally by dividing the work into independent tasks,
each with a clear scope and value.
This approach allows:
- better control over scope and priorities
- realistic estimation based on complexity

Test Design Techniques
The following techniques would be applied:
1. Equivalence Partitioning – for parameters with defined valid and invalid value sets (e.g. by_type, by_postal)
2. Boundary Value Analysis – for pagination and limits (page, per_page)
3. Pairwise / Combinatorial Testing – for selected combinations of filters
4. Positive and Negative Testing – to validate both expected and erroneous inputs

Task Breakdown & Story Points

1. Test Analysis & Test Design

Scope:
analyze API documentation
identify critical scenarios
define test coverage and test sets
select test design techniques
Story Points: 3

2.Test Framework Setup

Scope:
project initialization
API client setup
configuration management
base test structure
README documentation
test execution instructions
basic reporting setup

Story Points: 5

3. Core Functional Tests

Scope:
GET request without parameters
status code validation
basic response structure checks
Story Points: 2

4. Filters Testing (Single Parameter)

Scope:
Independent tests for each filter: by_city, by_state etc,
Validation that returned data actually matches the applied filter.

Story Points: 5

5. Pagination & Limits

Scope:
page: first page, zero, large values
per_page: minimum, default, maximum, above maximum
consistency across pages

Story Points: 3

6. Sorting & Special Filters

Scope:
sorting with asc and desc
by_dist parameter
validation of incompatible parameters (by_dist with sort)

Story Points: 3

7. Negative & Edge Case Testing

Scope:
invalid parameter values
non-existing cities or countries
incorrect formats
expected behavior (empty list vs error response)

Story Points: 5 (or divide ito 2 tasks of 2 and 3 points)

8. Response Contract & Schema Validation

Scope:
mandatory fields presence
data types validation
API contract stability

Story Points: 3

Total Story Points: 29
